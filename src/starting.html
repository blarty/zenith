<h2>Running The Broker and Router</h2>
The Zenith distribution contains two services, the broker and the router.

The Broker pushes channel/service ID pairs to every Messaging service instance so that each serivce maintains it's own list of which service contains which channels.

The Router Service accepts messages and routes them to the appropriate service.
